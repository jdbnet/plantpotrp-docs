You can rob most ATMs around the map. To do this you'll need to buy an electronics kit from YouTool.

Once you have an electronics kit, walk up to an ATM and hold the ```ALT``` key then right click to open the menu and choose 'Rob ATM'

You will then begin to rob the ATM, then after some time you will be prompted to play the minigame.

Once complete, you should then get marked money added to your inventory.

To wash this marked money, go to one of the 'Money Wash' locations on the map and speak to the ped.

They will wash your money and give you clean cash in return.
