This works at any Fleeca branch.

There's two areas for the bank robbery.

The first room just requires an electronics kit which you can pickup from the YouTool Store.

The second room requires a security card which you can only get from the Blackmarket Arms Dealer on Cayo Perico.

The first room contains one trolley of money. The second room contains two additional trolleys.

Once the robbery is complete, you will get marked money.
