Using a pistol (may add other weapons later), you can aim this at an NPC and after 5 seconds of aiming at them they will either run away from you, fight you, or stop with their hands up.

If they stop with their hands up, walk up to them and hold the ```ALT``` key then right click to open the menu and choose 'Rob NPC'.

At this point, you will receive some money from them or you will get a message saying they have no cash on them.
