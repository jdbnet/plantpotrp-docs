You can rob most stores around the map. To do this you'll need to buy a lockpick from YouTool.

Once you have a lockpick, go to a store and walk up to the cash register.

Make sure you have the lockpick in your hotbar, then press whichever button is allocated to the lockpick on your hotbar.

If you successfully pick the lock, the cash register will then begin being emptied. Note that at this point the police may have been alerted.

You should then get marked money added to your inventory.

To wash this marked money, go to one of the 'Money Wash' locations on the map and speak to the ped.

They will wash your money and give you clean cash in return.
